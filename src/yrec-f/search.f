      REAL*8 XTAB(JSON),S
      INTEGER FND,FIRST
C
C SEARCH CONDUCTS A BINARY SEARCH FOR S. SEARCH IS CALLED ONLY IF S IS
C BETWEEN XTAB(1) AND XTAB(NUM).
C
C ON INPUT--
C
C   XTAB CONTAINS THE ABSCISSAS OF THE DATA POINTS OF INTERPOLATION.
C
C   NUM IS THE DIMENSION OF XTAB
C
C   S IS THE VALUE WHOSE RELATIVE POSITION IN XTAB IS LOCATED BY SEARCH.
C
C
C ON OUTPUT--
C
C   FND IS SET EQUAL TO 1 IF S IS FOUND IN XTAB AND IS SET EQUAL TO 0
C   OTHERWISE.
C
C   LCN IS THE INDEX OF THE LARGEST VALUE IN XTAB FOR WHICH XTAB(I)
C   .LT. S.
C
C AND
C
C   SEARCH DOES NOT ALTER XTAB,NUM,S.
